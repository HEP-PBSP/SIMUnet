The Top Sector
=====================================================
We assess the impact of top quark production at the LHC on global analyses of PDFs and of Wilson coefficients in the SMEFT, both separately and in the framework of a joint interpretation.
A broad set of top quark data is considered, containing all available measurements based on the full Run II luminosity.  

See the :ref:`dataset<dataset>` section
for a detailed list of these measurements.

First, we determine the constraints that this dataset provides on the large-x gluon PDF.

Second, we carry out a SMEFT interpretation of the same dataset using state-of-the-art SM and EFT theory calculations, resulting in bounds on 25 Wilson coefficients.

Subsequently, we integrate the two analyses within the SIMUnet approach to realise a simultaneous determination of the SMEFT PDFs and the EFT coefficients.

See Ref. :cite:`Kassabov:2023hbm` for more details of this study.
