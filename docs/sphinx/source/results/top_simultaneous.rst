Simultaneous SMEFT and PDF fits
=================================

Here we provide the results of a simultaneous 
PDF and SMEFT determination in the top sector.

The simultaneous PDF and SMEFT fit shown here can be reproduced using
the SIMUnet methodology: see :ref:`the tutorials section<tutorials>` for more details.

Below, we show the PDF resulting from the simultaneous fit in green.  This SMEFT PDF
is compared two SM PDF fits: NNPDF4.0-notop (no top data) and fit H (all top data),
both of which are discussed in more detail in the :ref:`SM PDFs<smpdfs>` section.

We observe that the impact of the top quark data on the large-x gluon PDF is
diluted in the simultaneous fit: the Wilson coefficients reabsorb some of the constraining
power of the top sector.

The constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the SMEFT are shown below.
We compare the constraints from the simultaneous fit with the constraints from a fixed-PDF fit, and find that
the constrainst are stable.
