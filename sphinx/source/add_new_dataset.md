Main points:

- adding a file to the theory/simu_factors folder (maybe explain how to get the theory)

- explanation of the structure of the SIMU_datasetname.yaml file and of the mandatory keys.
    also add an example of a yaml file.

- what to include in the runcard (simu_fac, and simu_parameters) + example of yaml file.
