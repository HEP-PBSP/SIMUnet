The Drell-Yan sector
=====================================================
See Ref. :cite:`Iranipour:2022iak` for more details of this study, and Refs. :cite:`Greljo:2021kvv` and :cite:`Carrazza:2019sec`
for related work on simultaneous fits of Drell-Yan and deep inelastic data.

**Rewrite here, different to abstract:**
The high-energy tails of charged- and neutral-current Drell-Yan processes provide 
important constraints on the light quark and anti-quark parton distribution functions 
(PDFs) in the large-:math:`x` region.

At the same time, short-distance new physics effects such as those encoded by the 
Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) would induce smooth distortions to 
the same high-energy Drell-Yan tails.

In this work, we assess for the first time the interplay between PDFs and EFT effects 
for high-mass Drell-Yan processes at the LHC and quantify the impact that the consistent 
joint determination of PDFs and Wilson coefficients has on the bounds derived for the latter.

We consider two well-motivated new physics scenarios: :math:`1)` electroweak oblique 
corrections (:math:`\hat W, \hat Y`) and :math:`2)` four-fermion interactions potentially 
related to the LHCb anomalies in :math:`R(K^{*})`.

We account for available Drell-Yan data, both from unfolded cross sections and from 
searches, and carry out dedicated projections for the High-Luminosity LHC.

Our main finding is that, while the interplay between PDFs and EFT effects remains moderate 
for the current dataset, it will become a significant challenge for EFT analyses at the HL-LHC.
